# FunTrivia Category Mapping Status

## ✅ Problem Solved
**Original Issue**: Unknown categories automatically defaulted to "General" → causing data pollution

**Root Cause**: We were trying to map specific quiz titles instead of actual FunTrivia categories

## 🎯 Correct Approach 
Focus on mapping **actual FunTrivia category structure**:

### Categories to Map:
- **Domains**: `TV Trivia`, `Brainteasers`, `Geography`, `Science`, etc.
- **Difficulties**: `Easy`, `Tough`, `Average` → `Easy`, `Hard`, `Normal`

### Example (from your screenshot):
- ✅ **Domain**: "TV Trivia" → maps to `Culture` 
- ✅ **Difficulty**: "Tough" → maps to `Hard`
- ❌ **Quiz Title**: "Dragonball Z - A Black Day for Planet Earth" → NOT relevant

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ What's Working:
- Domain mapping is correctly detecting categories like "Brainteasers"
- Added comprehensive mappings for actual FunTrivia categories
- Strict mapping mode implemented (fails on unknown categories instead of defaulting)

### 🔧 What Still Needs Fix:
- Some topic extraction is still pulling quiz titles instead of proper categories
- Need to verify all FunTrivia domains are covered in mappings

### ✅ Added to Mappings:
- `brainteasers` → Education
- `global trivia` → Geography  
- `tv trivia` → Culture/Television
- Many other standard trivia categories

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Test with strict mapping**: `python src/main.py --strict-mapping --max-questions 5`
2. **Add missing categories** as they're discovered in logs
3. **Focus on categories, not quiz titles**

## 📋 Mapping Strategy
```
Domain Mapping:    "TV Trivia" → Culture
Topic Mapping:     "Television" → Television  
Difficulty:        "Tough" → Hard
```

This approach is **much simpler** and **semantically correct** compared to trying to map thousands of individual quiz titles.
