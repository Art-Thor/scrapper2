    3. Regarding the Max Brooks book titled "World War Z", what does the 'Z' stand for?
    
    ‚ùå Your Answer: [No Answer]
    
    The correct answer was Zombie
    
    Written after "The Zombie Survival Guide", Max Brooks created the "Oral History of the Zombie War" in releasing "World War Z" in 2006, chronicling the rise of a zombie outbreak through its stages and following the international efforts to abate it as told through first-hand accounts.
    
    The novel was a major success, becoming a bestseller and continuing a rising trend in zombie media at the time. The book was adapted into a Brad Pitt film in 2013 and a video game in 2019. Max Brooks, interestingly, is the son of famous comedic filmmaker Mel Brooks.
