    7. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Easter Vigil is held late in the day on Holy Saturday. The rubrics of the Mass call for the faithful to do something they have not done at any services since the beginning of Lent. What is this?
    
    ‚ùå Your Answer: [No Answer]
    
    The correct answer was Use the word "Alleluia"
    
    "Alleluia" is a term considered appropriate to celebrations of the risen Christ, and therefore not said during Lent. The Easter Vigil customarily lasts about three hours. In many areas, it is held so as to run from late Saturday night until early Easter Sunday morning. It is also the service at which new converts are received into the church, through Baptism and/or Confirmation.
